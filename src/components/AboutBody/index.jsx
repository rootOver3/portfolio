              There are some called Muhammad. Even only in Bangladesh. Before,
              my name was Abu Taher â€“ and I only existed under this name once.
              But this is another story.

              What is true then as now: I am a designer and developer. To be
              precise, I solve people&apos;s problems thus and so that they get
              a smile on their face afterward look more beautiful than before or
              perform not like before. Maybe more practical to use. Websites,
              user interfaces, apps, and things like that. Some think I&apos;m
              totally creative and just one of those people; who make everything
              they put their hands on stunning. I see myself more as a problem
              solver who lives out his trained profession as a web developer
              with ambition and still wants to learn more today. I&apos;m more
              of a freethinker than a web developer. But that&apos;s just
              terminology anyway.

              After completing junior high school, I started learning web
              development while continuing my school. After gaining enough
              skillset began my apprenticeship in a small digital studio in the
              middle of the beautiful Sylhet in Bangladesh. I had great seniors
              like Saidul Islam(CEO of Freelancerlab) brother and Arif uncle,
              who trained my vision and taught me how to make things innovative
              and legible.

              I then worked with various people/agencies. During these years, in
              addition to great mentors and orders, a highlight was Muhammad
              Abdullah, for whom I was allowed to be a web developer myself. We
              still work together today on various freelance projects, but
              Abdullah has long been in the fast lane.
